# Automated Testing

---

## What is a test?

Acceptance Criteria + Application = Pass or Fail

---

## Why do we test?

- To verify the software does what we want it to do
  - Meets business requirements
  - Responds gracefully when something goes wrong
- Nothing has broken since the last time we tested

---

## Ways to test

### Manual test

### Automated test

---

## Why automated tests?

- Fast
- Consistently repeatable
- Protects working code
- Retains problem domain knowledge

#### "A good software engineer writes good code. A great software engineer writes tests for their code."

---

## "But we don't have time to write tests!"

- Setting expectations
- It will break. When will you find out?
- Fire prevention vs fire fighting
- Technical debt

---

## "Tests are hard, and I'm still not convinced"
